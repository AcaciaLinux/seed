#!seed

version: 1 # The version of this file

seed: # Indicates that the seed file starts here
# Gets processed from top to bottom in the order as described in this file.

  env: # Setup environment variables
    chrootcmd: systemd-nspawn -d {ROOTDIR} {COMMAND} # The command to use for chrooting into the new system
    # - {ROOTDIR}: The absolute path to the newly installed system
    # - {COMMAND}: The command to execute in the chroot environment
    # Gets used for leaf too

  disks: # Setup the disks
    - /dev/sda: # The disk /dev/sda
      action: alter # Can be [alter, keep, locked, new]
      # - 'alter'   Alters the partitions on the system
      # - 'keep'    Forbids any modificatins to the filesystem, no changes in layout ('size' gets ignored)
      # - 'locked'  Forbids any changes to the filesystem, just mounting (only 'mount' and 'fstab' get used)
      # - 'new'     Creates a new partition table on the disk ('table' is required)
      table: gpt

      partitions: # Describe the partitions on that disk

        - /dev/sda1: # The first partition on the diskk
          action: shrink # The action to perform on the partition
            # Can be [keep, shrink, create]
          size: 500M # The new size for the partition
            # Sizes can beÂ [B, K, M, G, T, %, %%, min, max]
            # - If '%' is specified, the partition size gets calculated from the total disk size
            # - If '%%' is specified, the partition size gets calculated from
            #   the amount of space remaining from upper partitions (in this file, not the real disk)
            # - If 'min' (shrink only) is specified, the size is the absolute minimum
            #   for the remaining partition to not corrupt it
            # - If 'max' is specified, this uses all the remaining space from the disk.
            #   Partitions specified after this will result in an error
          fs: fat # The filesystem to use
            # - If this is 'keep', the filesystem gets reused
            # This piece gets appended to the mkfs.<fs> command
          fsargs: -F32 # Additional arguments for the mkfs command
          mount: /boot/efi # Where to mount the partition on the target system
            # Can be omitted if the partition should not be mounted
          fstab: true # If this parition should enter the fstab
            # This lets the target system mount the partition automatically
            # Default if omitted: false

  installation: # Describe the installation leaf should perform

      - base
      - bash
      - systemd
      - networkmanager

  fstab: # The fstab to generate
    mode: uuid # The mode for the fstab
    # Can be [uuid, label, device]
    # - 'uuid':   Use the partition UUID (UUID=) (recommended, default)
    # - 'label'   Use the label (LABEL=) of the partitions
    # - 'device'  Use the device identifier eg. /dev/sda1 (not recommended)
    path: /etc/fstab
    # The path to store the fstab in
    # Default: /etc/fstab

  systemd: # Configure systemd
    enable-units: # Which units to enable for the next start
      - sshd
